Programming language,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language,"Aprogramming languageis a system of notation for writingcomputer programs.[1]Programming languages are described in terms of theirsyntax(form) andsemantics(meaning), usually defined by aformal language. Languages usually provide features such as atype system,variables, and mechanisms forerror handling. Animplementationof a programming language is required in order toexecuteprograms, namely aninterpreteror acompiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while acompilerproduces anexecutableprogram.",1
ABAP,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP,"ABAP(Advanced Business Application Programming, originallyAllgemeiner Berichts-Aufbereitungs-Prozessor, German for ""general report preparation processor""[2]) is ahigh-level programming languagecreated by the GermansoftwarecompanySAP SE. It is currently positioned, alongsideJava, as the language for programming theSAP NetWeaver Application Server, which is part of theSAP NetWeaverplatform for building business applications.",1
Ada (programming language),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language),"Adais astructured,statically typed,imperative, andobject-orientedhigh-level programming language, inspired byPascaland other languages. It has built-in language support fordesign by contract(DbC), extremelystrong typing, explicit concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, andnon-determinism. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using thecompilerto find errors in favor ofruntimeerrors. Ada is aninternationaltechnical standard, jointly defined by theInternational Organization for Standardization(ISO), and theInternational Electrotechnical Commission(IEC). As of May 2023[update], the standard, called Ada 2022 informally, is ISO/IEC 8652:2023.[11]",2
